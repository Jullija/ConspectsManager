Ladies and gentelman, here comes **the best FileExplorer** available.

## Another File Explorer?
Yup.

But in our program not only can you traverse through directories but also **create copies, import templates or edit markdowns**. It will be like your best friend at the party - he will twist and shout along with you!

## Technical informations

React.js and Django.


## How to use?
We don't know yet, but as soon as we know, we'll tell you ;)
